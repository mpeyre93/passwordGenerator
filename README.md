## JavaScript: Password Generator

This application was created to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Functionality 

When user clicks "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts will be presented to the user with password criteria that the user can choose.
User is first prompted to choose a password of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
If the users chooses a number outside of 8-128, the user will be alerted with a message informing them their password must be between 8 and 128.
When prompted for character types to include in the password the users can choose to include numbers, symbols, uppercase letters and lowercase letters.
If the user confirms each criteria from the prompts, then the password will include all the criteria options.
If the user does not confirm a criteria prompt, then that criteria will not appear in the password.
When all prompts are answered the password is generated and displayed in the text area in place of "Your Secure Password".
If the user does not confirm any of the criteria prompts, the user will be alerted with a message informing them they need to choose a criteria for a password to be created.
